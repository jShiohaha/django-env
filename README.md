# django-env
##### This is a simple python script to go through the process of setting up a django project for you. Simply put - I got tired of going through all the monotonous steps every time I wanted to start a new project.
***

# Installation Requirements
- Python3
- Pip (If you don't have it, you can go to Homebrew's website or run the following on a Mac)
```Python
sudo easy_install pip
```

# Pulling and running the script
### Getting the code:
- You can either copy the raw code (*lame*) or you can create a git repository, set the remote, and pull (*cool* program-my way)

I will show you how to do the *cool* program-my stuff if you don't know how (no shame... learn now, and you'll feel like a *BOSS*!! So, go to the directory where you want to store this stuff and run the following commands

*Note*: Don't actually type in `whatever_name_you_want`, name it whatever
```bash
mkdir whatever_name_you_want
cd whatever_name_you_want
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/jShiohaha/django-env.git
git pull remote origin
```
**BOOM. YOU'RE A BOSS.**

### Running the code:
- Simply run the command `Python3 django_constructor.py` and that will kick off the script! Obviously, if you don't have python3, you could run into some issues. Anyways, the change is inevitable, so join us on the **dark** side ;)
