# django-env

This is a simple python script to go through the process of setting up a django project for you. Simply put - I got tired of going through all the monotonous steps every time I wanted to start a new project.
***

# Installation Requirements
- Python3
- Pip (If you don't have it, you can go to Homebrew's website or run the following on a Mac)
```Python
sudo easy_install pip
```

# Pulling and running the script
### Getting the code:
You can either copy the raw code or you can create a git repository, set the remote, and pull the master branch onto your local computer. So, go to the directory where you want to store this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir directory_name
cd directory_name
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/jShiohaha/django-env.git
git pull remote origin
```
**BOOM. YOU'RE A BOSS.**

### Running the code:
Simply run the command `Python3 django_constructor.py` and that will kick off the script! Obviously, if you don't have python3, you won't be able to run this script.
